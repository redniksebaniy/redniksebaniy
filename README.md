### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Junior Unity Developer and a final year student of BSUIR. 

Experienced in game development for two years: participating in gamejams, doing lab work, and a lot of self-study.

Realized my own project:
https://github.com/redniksebaniy/Clone-Escape-3D 

Worked with design patterns (Singleton, Observer, Command), MVC, and is also familiar with the DOTween plugin.
